Current World Population
[+]
[â]
World Population:
 Updated with the 
2024 United Nations Revision
reached 8 billion in 2022, according to United Nations estimates.
is projected to reach 9 billion in 2037, and 10 billion in 2060.
has doubled in 40 years from 1959 (3 billion) to 1999 (6 billion).
is currently (2025) growing at a rate of around 0.85% per year, adding around 70 million people per year to the total.
growth rate reached its peak in the late 1960s, when it was at 2.09%.
growth rate is currently declining and is projected to continue to decline in the coming years (reaching below 0.50% by 2047, reach 0 in 2084, and decline by -0.12% in 2100) .
a tremendous change occurred with the industrial revolution: whereas it had taken all of human history up to the year 1800 for world population to reach 1 billion, the second billion was achieved in only 130 years (1930), the third billion in 30 years (1960), the fourth billion in 15 years (1974), the fifth billion in 13 years (1987), the sixth billion in 11 years (1998), the seventh billion and eighth billion in 12 years each (2010 and 2022). During the 20th century alone, the population in the world has grown from 1.65 billion to 6 billion.
